# BenchFlow Documentation


## Tooling setup

To use our Gruntfile and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of BenchFlow's documentation source files, Node, and Grunt. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:

1. [Download and install Node](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Install the Grunt command line tools, `grunt-cli`, with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Navigate to the root `/docs` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in [package.json](https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/tree/devel/docs/package.json).
4. [Install Ruby][install-ruby], install [Bundler][gembundler] with `gem install bundler`, and finally run `bundle install`. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

## Local documentation

Running our documentation locally requires the use of Jekyll, a decently flexible static site generator that provides us: basic includes, Markdown-based files, templates, and more. Here's how to get it started:

1. Run through the [tooling setup](#tooling-setup) above to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. From the root `/docs` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.
