## Overview



## Where we Do Collect which Notes/TODOs

*Note:* Our main concern is to use tools that enable versioning, also for collecting notes and TODOs. 

- **Code related notes**:
    - *TODO in the code*: if it is something we are going to solve soon in one of the next iterations
    - *[Issue](https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/issues)*: everything about what is going to be implemented/fixed in current or next iterations

- **Functionality related notes**:
    - *[BenchFlow Temporary Documentation](https://github.com/VincenzoFerme/benchflow-temporary-documentation)*: ongoing discussion about proposed functionality that we are not sure are going to happen (always on the master branch). This avoid overloading the issue section of BenchFlow. 
    - *[Issue](https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/issues)*: everything about what is going to be implemented/fixed in current or next iterations

- **Project management related notes**:
    - *[BenchFlow Developers Documentation](https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow)*: everything that has to be shared in the team
    - *[Vincenzo] Private Notability Notes*: private management stuff

- **Foreseen future work related notes**:
    - *[Vincenzo] Private Notability Notes*: everything about foreseen next steps and related material
