# This is the first start-up file for the chaperone base images.  Note that start-up files
# are processed in order alphabetically, so settings in later files can override those in
# earlier files.

# General environmental settings.  These settings apply to all services and logging entries.
# There should be only one "settings" directive in each configuration file.  But, any
# settings encountered in subsequent configuration files can override or augment these.
# Note that variables are expanded as late as possile.  So, there can be variables
# defined here which depend upon variables which will be defined later (such as _CHAP_SERVICE),
# which is defined implicitly for each service.
