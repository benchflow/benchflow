# This script is meant for quick & easy install via:
#   'wget -qO- https://github.com/benchflow/client/releases/download/<version>/benchflow | sh'
#
# How to use this script to install BenchFlow:
#   1. Log into your Ubuntu or OSX terminal as a user with `sudo` privileges.
#	2. Verify that you have `wget` installed.

# 		$ which wget

# 	3. If `wget` isnâ€™t installed, install it after updating your package manager (for OSX install brew if not already installed: http://brew.sh):
		
#		Ubuntu:
# 		$ sudo apt-get update

# 		$ sudo apt-get install wget

#		OSX:
# 		$ sudo brew update

# 		$ sudo brew install wget

#
# 	4. Get the latest BenchFlow package.

#		$ wget -qO- https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/releases/download/<version>/getBenchFlow.sh | sh

# 	   The system prompts you for your sudo password. Then, it downloads and installs BenchFlow and its dependencies.

# 	5. Verify `benchflow` is installed correctly.

#		$ benchflow
